# Anxiety-Relief Spotify Playlists

Here, I have used Spotify's API and Python to make playlists for individuals to help them deal with anxiety and stress, personalized for them. This was done by studying and exploiting several parameters like the ideal tempo, instrumentalness, and speech levels that have been shown to improve outcomes in allowing someone to relax. The personalization comes from either using the user's top tracks or having them input a song of interest to make recommendations. This data in combination with the target levels of several musical variables allows for a more personalized approach to achieving relief from anxiety that has the potential to provide more effective recommendations.

However, this also has the potential to enhance the general Spotify recommendations from user's preferences. Thus, I have also provided code allowing users to input genres of interest (can find genre options in .txt file) for more general song recommendations.
