# Anxiety-Relief Spotify Playlists

Here, I have used Spotify's API to make playlists for individuals to help them deal , personalized for them. This was done by studying and exploiting several parameters like the ideal tempo, instrumentalness, and speech levels that have been shown to improve outcomes in allowing someone to relax. The personalization comes from either using the user's top tracks or having them input a song of interest to make recommendations. This data in combination with the target levels of several musical variables allows for a more personalized approach to achieving relief from anxiety that has the potential to provide more effective recommendations.
